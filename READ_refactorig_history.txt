1. Part of reapeating code was deleted (DRY method): 
for example dice_image.py - roll of "5" is set by combining "4" and "1"

2. Verification of used modules, removal of unused modules

3. Name change of unused (but required) function arguments:
for example in def dice_result(x, y) -> def dice_result(_, __)

4. Code was set in functions, lack of code in global form

5. Removal of "exit" button as it was unnecessary feature

6. Small changes to increas code readability (removing/adding whitespaces, blank lines etc.)

7. Changing the code to make it easier to modify the number of players

8. Adding new feature: user decides how many players will play (1 - 5)

9. Adding new feature: users can choose color of their turtle
